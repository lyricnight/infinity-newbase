# Infinity
````
Infinity is a 1.20.4 client, made by lyric and Valser, with a custom event system thanks to RailHack.
The client was made to learn how to develop on the Fabric platform, and newer versions of Minecraft.
The client is not intended to be used by itself - it is meant to be a 'side' client to something like Future.

The client has several ways that it is optimised:
- Using mixins to handle certain reoccuring events rather than the EventBus to reduce latency (see OtherEntityManager for examples)
- Having a clearly defined structure for modules, instead of throwing everything in Utils
- Having a simple setting system
- Having a custom EventBus that performs extremely well (thanks to RailHack)
- Limiting the use of @EventHandler as much as possible
